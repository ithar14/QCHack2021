Quantum computers operate on different sets of physical laws than classical computers. One consequence of this is "interference". Like with waves, there can be constructive (additive) or destructive (subtraction) interference. Harnessing this property in a quantum circuit can lead to 'correct' answers interfering constructively and 'wrong' answers destructively, essentially nullifying them.
