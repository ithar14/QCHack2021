Quantum computers operate on different sets of physical laws than classical computers. One consequence of this is "interference". Like with waves, there can be constructive (additive) or destructive (subtraction) interference. Harnessing this property in a quantum circuit can lead to 'correct' answers interfering constructively and 'wrong' answers destructively, essentially nullifying them.

A pure qubit state is a coherent superposition of the basis states

when measured, the qubit has a probability  \left| \alpha ^{2}\right| and a probability \left| \beta^{2}\right|. In other words, superposition means that there is no way, even in principle, to tell which of the two possible states forming the superposition state actually pertains. Furthermore, the probability amplitudes, encode more than just the probabilities of the outcomes of a measurement; the relative phase of is responsible for quantum interference.
